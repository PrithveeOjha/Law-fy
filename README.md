# Law-fy (a working PC game has been attatched with the game, download the Test 1.0 file to play it.)

## Problem Statement
Many students in schools and universities lack awareness about their legal rights, primarily because these topics are inadequately covered in the curriculum. This knowledge gap is even more pronounced in rural areas, where approximately 70% of residents are illiterate, and awareness of legal rights is limited. Existing awareness campaigns have proven ineffective, often due to a lack of interest and interactivity among students.

## Proposed Solution
We aim to address this critical issue with our project, the Legal Education Game. Our solution involves creating an interactive educational game that immerses users in scenarios and quizzes related to legal rights and responsibilities. To motivate consistent learning and progression, we'll incorporate a rewards system within the game. We also place a strong emphasis on user-friendliness to ensure an engaging learning experience.
